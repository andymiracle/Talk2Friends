Improved capabilities:

For Project 2.5, we implemented a new feature for notifications for friend requests. It involves a notification bell icon that has a red circle appear on it when the current user has incoming friend requests and it stays red when the current user still has friend requests. Also, clicking on the notification bell icon directs them to the friends request page.
